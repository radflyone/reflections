When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?  Whenever I wish to have a remote copy of my project for personal use or for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? Allows commit comments and lessens too many commits in history.
